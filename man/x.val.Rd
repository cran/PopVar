\arguments{
\item{G.in}{\code{Matrix} of genotypic data. First row contains marker names and the first column contains entry (taxa) names. Genotypes should be coded using the (1, 0, -1, NA) format familiar to users of \code{\link{rrBLUP}} (\cite{Endelman, 2011}). TIP - Set header=\code{FALSE} within \code{read.table} or \code{read.csv} when importing a tab-delimited file containing data for \code{G.in}.}

\item{y.in}{\code{Matrix} of phenotypic data. First column contains entry (taxa) names found in \code{G.in}, regardless of whether the entry has a phenotype for any or all traits. Additional columns contain phenotypic data; column names should reflect the trait name(s). TIP - Set header=\code{TRUE} within \code{read.table} or \code{read.csv} when importing a tab-delimited file contianing dat}

\item{min.maf}{Optional \code{numeric} indicating a minimum minor allele frequency (MAF) when filtering \code{G.in}. Markers with an MAF < \code{min.maf} will be removed. Default is \code{0.01} to remove monomorphic markers. Set to \code{0} for no filtering.}

\item{mkr.cutoff}{Optional \code{numeric} indicating the maximum missing data per marker when filtering \code{G.in}. Markers missing > \code{mkr.cutoff} data will be removed. Default is \code{0.50}. Set to \code{1} for no filtering.}

\item{entry.cutoff}{Optional \code{numeric} indicating the maximum missing genotypic data per entry alloed when filtering \code{G.in}. Entries missing > \code{entry.cutoff} marker data will be removed. Default is \code{0.50}. Set to \code{1} for no filtering.}

\item{remove.dups}{Optional \code{logical}. If \code{TRUE} duplicate entries in the genotype matrix, if present, will be removed. This step may be necessary for missing marker imputation (see \code{impute.EM} below). Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{impute.EM}{Optional \code{logical}. If \code{TRUE} missing genotypic data will be imputed via the EM algorithm implemented in \code{\link{rrBLUP}} (\cite{Endelman, 2011}; \cite{Poland et al., 2012}). If \code{FALSE} missing genotypic data will be imputed via the 'marker mean' method, also implemented in \code{\link{rrBLUP}}. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{frac.train}{Optional \code{numeric} indicating the fraction of the TP that is used to estimate marker effects (i.e. the prediction set) under cross-validation (CV) method 1 (see \code{Details}). The remaining \eqn{(1-frac.trait)} of the TP will then comprise the prediction set.}

\item{nCV.iter}{Optional \code{integer} indicating the number of times to iterate \emph{CV method 1} described in \code{Details}. Default is \code{100}.}

\item{nFold}{Optional \code{integer}. If a number is provided, denoting the number of "folds", then CV will be conducted using \emph{CV method 2} (see \code{Details}). Default is \code{NULL}, resulting in the default use of the \emph{CV method 1}.}

\item{nFold.reps}{Optional \code{integer} indicating the number of times \emph{CV method 2} is repeated. The CV accuracy returned is the average \emph{r} of each rep. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{return.estimates}{Optional \code{logical}. If \code{TRUE} additional items including the marker effect and beta estimates from the selected prediction model (i.e. highest CV accuracy) will be returned.}

\item{CV.burnIn}{Optional \code{integer} argument used by \code{\link[BGLR]{BGLR}} when fitting Bayesian models. Default is \code{750}.}

\item{CV.nIter}{Optional \code{integer} argument used by \code{\link[BGLR]{BGLR}} (\cite{de los Compos and Rodriguez, 2014}) when fitting Bayesian models. Default is \code{1500}.}

\item{models}{Optional \code{character vector} of the regression models to be used in CV and to estimate marker effects. Options include \code{rrBLUP, BayesA, BayesB, BayesC, BL, BRR}, one or more may be included at a time. By default all models are tested.}

\description{
\code{x.val} performs cross-validation (CV) to estimate the accuracy of genome-wide prediction (otherwise known as genomic selection) for a specific training population (TP), i.e. a set of individuals for which phenotypic and genotypic data is available. Cross-validation can be conducted via one of two methods within \code{x.val}, see \code{Details} for more information.

             NOTE - \code{x.val}, specifically \code{\link[BGLR]{BGLR}} writes and reads files to disk so it is highly recommended to set your working directory

\details{
Two CV methods are available within \code{PopVar}: \itemize{
           \item \code{CV method 1}: During each iteration a training (i.e. model training) set will be \strong{randomly sampled} from the TP of size \eqn{N*(frac.train)}, where \emph{N} is the size of the TP, and the remainder of the TP is assigned to the validation set. The accuracies of individual models are expressed as average Pearson's correlation coefficient (\emph{r}) between the genome estimated breeding value (GEBV) and observed phenotypic values in the validation set across all \code{nCV.iter} iterations. Due to its amendibility to various TP sizes, \emph{CV method 1} is the default CV method in \code{\link{pop.predict}}.
           \item \code{CV method 2}: \code{nFold} \strong{independent} validation sets are sampled from the TP and predicted by the remainder. For example, if \eqn{nFold = 10} the TP will be split into 10 equal sets, each containing \eqn{1/10}-th of the TP, which will be predicted by the remaining \eqn{9/10}-ths of the TP. The accuracies of individual models are expressed as the average (\emph{r}) between the GEBV and observed phenotypic values in the validation set across all \code{nFold} folds. The process can be repeated \code{nFold.reps} times with \code{nFold} new independent sets being sampled each replication, in which case the reported prediction accuracies are averages across all folds and replications.
